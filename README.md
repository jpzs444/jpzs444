# Hello, World! 
I am JPâ€”a second-year Information Technology student in the Philippines. I currently study programming in my own small space at home. If I am not coding or watching videos of tech professionals on YouTube, I am most likely scrolling through social media and GitHub or drinking a hot cup of coffee while playing Valorant with my closest friends.
